      <h1>Playing Windows Doors</h1>
      <p>
        This SWF is from <a href="https://newgrounds.com/">NEWGROUNDS</a> and is
        just meant to be their but, since i like the game itself i just put it
        here.If it perhaps doesn't work then it will have to be on newgrounds to
        play it.
